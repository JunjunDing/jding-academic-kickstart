We are looking for highly motivated graduate students and undergraduate students to join the group.

* Materials Science and Engineering Graduate Program 

Alfred University offers M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Materials Science and Engineering (MSE). The M.S. program emphasizes hands-on studies that enable graduates to readily move into careers ranging from applied research and development to plant operations and technical management. The Ph.D. program offers a blend of theoretical and applied studies enabling graduates to tackle fundamental problems in materials science and engineering. Our Ph.D. graduates are employed in academia, national labs, and industry with careers in education, research and development, and technical management.

Alfred University is well recognized as a leader in ceramics and glass education and research for over 100 years. Collectively, our Ph.D. programs in Ceramics, Glass and Materials Science and Engineering are ranked among the top 50 Materials Science and Engineering programs in the nation.
