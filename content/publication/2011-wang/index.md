abstract = "Femtosecond laser induced two-photon polymerization has the advantages of high resolution and capability of true three-dimensional (3D) fabrication. In this work, a phase filter-based super-resolution technique was adopted to reduce the size of focus spot in order to achieve exceeded diffraction limit fabrication resolution. The principle of phase modulation of a femtosecond laser was introduced, the parameters of the phase filter were optimized using a genetic algorithm, and then a 3D super-resolution annular phase filter was fabricated. Experimental results proved that the aspect ratio as well as the axial and radial sizes of solidified units was compressed by the optimized phase filter. A maximum aspect ratio compression ratio of 20.8% was achieved. The radial compression ratio of the modulated spot decreased with the increase of laser exposure amount, while the axial compression ratio and aspect ratio compression ratio increased."
