abstract = "Femtosecond Laser is a unique tool for micro and nano fabrication. In this paper, femtosecond laser micro-fabrication is developed as a cell microsurgery technique in micro cutting of living cell?s filopodia. We have investigated the interaction between femtosecond laser and Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell, the optimization of micro surgery parameters such as laser energy and exposure time, the designed cutting process of MDCK cell?s pseudopod. Furthermore, the cell?s living activity of wound response to cutting was observted and analyzed. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of micro and nano surgery of live cell by femtosecond laser selectivity cutting without compromising the activity of the cells."
