abstract = "A novel method of the micro device mould fabrication is reported, which combine the femtosecond two-photon polymerization and micro electroforming. As example of the results, a 2?2 micro lens array (MLA) with diameter of 10?m and a micro gear are fabricated using S-3 photo resist by two-photon polymerization, which use an alternative annular scanning mode with continuous variable layer space after parameter optimization to achieve good surface appearance. Then the MLA and the micro gear are electroformed to obtain nickel mould. Compared to the conventional method, this work provides an alternative, fast and effective processing method for the fabrication of micro device mould that requires arbitrary shape with high surface quality and small scale."
