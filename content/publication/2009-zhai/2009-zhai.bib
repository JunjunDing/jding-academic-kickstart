 abstract = {Optical tweezers have been successfully utilized in various scientific and engineering fields such as medicine, biology and MEMS. However, there is still a lack of a sophisticated model for optical tweezers on driving complex objects. In this paper a new electromagnetic model of optical tweezers based on moment method is presented. Optical force acting on a single microsphere and two microspheres is experimentally analyzed and the experimental results are compared with the simulated ones which are obtained by our model. A microrotor which can be used as a mixer in a lab-on-chip is also analyzed by the model. The results indicate that the algorithm presented here can be easily extended to multi complex structures and to torque computation algorithms, thus providing a highly flexible and universally useable computation engine.},
