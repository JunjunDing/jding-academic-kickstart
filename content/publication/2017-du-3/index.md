abstract = "Abstract DNA is the hereditary material that contains our unique genetic code. Since the first demonstration of two-dimensional (2D) nanopatterns by using designed DNA origami ~10 years ago, DNA has evolved into a novel technique for 2D and 3D nanopatterning. It is now being used as a template for the creation of sub-10 nm structures via either “top-down” or “bottom-up” approaches for various applications spanning from nanoelectronics, plasmonic sensing, and nanophotonics. The perspective starts with an histroric overview and discusses the current state-of-the-art in DNA nanolithography. Emphasis is put on the challenges and prospects of DNA nanolithography as the next generation nanomanufacturing technique."
