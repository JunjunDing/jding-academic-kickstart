abstract = "In this paper, standard involute microgears were fabricated by femtosecond two-photon polymerization (FTPP) in SU-8 photoresist. In order to obtain standard involute microgears with high-precision, the scan strategy for the fabrication of microgears was improved. The effects of photoresist curing, laser power and the scan step in the X/Y and Z directions on the quality of microgears were systematically studied. Relevant parameters of microfabrication were optimized. Based on these investigations, standard involute microgears with high dimension precision and finer surface morphology have been fabricated with laser power of 12 mW, steps of 0.1?m in the X/Y directions and 0.3 ?m in the Z direction. The pitch diameters are from 10 ?m to 30 ?m. Comparison of the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of microgears with the standard template has been made, and the dimension error is quantitatively estimated within 1 ?m."
