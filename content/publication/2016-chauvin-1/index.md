abstract = "Nanoporous materials are of great interest for various technological applications including sensors based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering, catalysis, and biotechnology. Currently, tremendous efforts are dedicated to the development of porous one-dimensional materials to improve the properties of such class of materials. The main drawback of the synthesis approaches reported so far includes (i) the short length of the porous nanowires, which cannot reach the macroscopic scale, and (ii) the poor organization of the nanostructures obtained by the end of the synthesis process. In this work, we report for the first time on a two-step approach allowing creating highly ordered porous gold nanowire arrays with a length up to a few centimeters. This two-step approach consists of the growth of gold/copper alloy nanowires by magnetron cosputtering on a nanograted silicon substrate, serving as a physical template, followed by a selective dissolution of copper by an electrochemical anodic process in diluted sulfuric acid. We demonstrate that the pore size of the nanowires can be tailored between 6 and 21 nm by tuning the dealloying voltage between 0.2 and 0.4 V and the dealloying time within the range of 150?600 s. We further show that the initial gold content (11 to 26 atom %) and the diameter of the gold/copper alloy nanowires (135 to 250 nm) are two important parameters that must carefully be selected to precisely control the porosity of the material."
