 abstract = {The research and development of low dimensional materials have accelerated at an enormous pace. Since the discovery of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by Iijima in 1991, there have been extensive research efforts on the synthesis, physics, electronics, chemistry and applications of one-dimensional (1D) materials, including nanotubes, nanowires, nanorods, nanofibers, and nanobelts. Recent advances in the modeling of phenomena during nanofabrication along with new methods and mechanics of controllable synthesis of 1D materials have paved the road for applications with increasing social impact, especially in energy generation and storage, bio-detection, wearable devices, specialized coatings, and environment monitoring.},
